# SoufraShare 
SoufraShare is a mobile application designed to reduce food waste by enabling community members to share or sell homemade meals at affordable prices. It connects home cooks (especially mothers) with students and busy individuals who want access to home-style food at low cost.


## Why this matters 
Food waste is a growing problem, while many students and working people struggle to find affordable, healthy meals. SoufraShare addresses both challenges by supporting food redistribution, affordability, and community-based micro-income opportunities.
